% in this section we review the design of a modern SOC with particular focus on
% it's clocking and reset structures, to motivate the design of our simulation
% infrastructure described later in this dissertation.

% Intro paragraph: Leave to introduction.
% - Talk about size
%  - 2.5 - 3D integration
%  - Give examples of large GPUs, CPUs
% - Heterogeneity
%   - Talk about specialization
%
% Combination of enormous size and increasing heterogenity leads to more complex
% clocking structures. Jump into this section assuming this has been established.
%

%  Overview of clock use in a modern SoC
%  - GALs
%  - Example SoC (eagle)
% Section: Clock domain crossings
% - Metastability, synchronizer chains
% - Fully asynchronous crossings
% - Rational crossings
% - Other types; see Ben Keller
% Section: Clock generation and selection structures
% - Clock Muxes
% - Clock Dividers
% - PLLs and DLLs
% Section: Reset sequences
% - How does a chip come out of reset, how do the clocks come up. Ordering considerations.
% Section: Clock gating
% Section: Dynamic frequency scaling
% - Explain what and why (DVFS)
% - Refer back to previous section RE: how clocks are reconfigured
% - Given an example system from Berkeley
% - Study an example system from not berkeley
% Clocks and EDA
% - SDC
