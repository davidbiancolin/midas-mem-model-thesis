    Abstract = {Rocket Chip is an open-source Sysem-on-Chip design generator that emits synthesizable RTL. It leverages the Chisel hardware construction language to compose a library of sophisticated generators for cores, caches, and interconnects into an integrated SoC. Rocket Chip generates general-purpose processor cores that use the open RISC-V ISA, and provides both an in-order core generator (Rocket) and an out-of-order core generator (BOOM). For SoC designers interested in utilizing heterogeneous specialization for added efficiency gains, Rocket Chip supports the integration of custom accelerators in the form of instruction set extensions, coprocessors, or fully independent novel cores. Rocket Chip has been taped out (manufactured) eleven times, and yielded functional silicon prototypes capable of booting Linux.}

    Number = {UCB/EECS-2015-167},
    Abstract = {BOOM is a synthesizable, parameterized, superscalar out-of-order RISC-V core designed to serve as the prototypical baseline processor for future micro-architectural studies of out-of-order processors. Our goal is to provide a readable, open-source implementation for use in education, research, and industry.

BOOM is written in roughly 9,000 lines of the hardware construction language Chisel. We leveraged Berkeley’s open-source Rocket-chip SoC generator, allowing us to quickly bring up an entire multi-core processor system (including caches and uncore) by replacing the in-order Rocket core with an out-of-order BOOM core. BOOM supports atomics, IEEE 754-2008 floating-point, and page-based virtual memory. We have demonstrated BOOM running Linux, SPEC CINT2006, and CoreMark.}
